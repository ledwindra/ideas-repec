# About ‚úåüèΩ

Hello world üåè! Are you an economist, or economics student, or just a random person like me who is interested in economics? Have you looked at IDEAS/RePEc statistics website? Do you wonder that you could grab them all without any hassle? Yes, right, you can get it here how! üòÉ

TL;DR: If you don't want to run this locally, you can just go straight to the data so you can just chill and relax. Grab them for [<strong>journal articles</strong>](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ledwindra/ideas-repec/master/data/journal-article.zip) and [<strong>working papers</strong>](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ledwindra/ideas-repec/master/data/working-paper.zip). üåû ‚õ± ü•• üå¥ üòé

# Use case

We can make a simple analysis regarding which papers are most popular on RePEc. The metrics can be total downloads. For example, see the Stata graph below (the program is inside the [<strong>do directory</strong>](https://github.com/ledwindra/ideas-repec/blob/master/do/ideas_repec.do)):

![author-most-downloaded](./img/author-most-downloaded.png)

The command is as follows:

```
graph bar (sum) file_downloads_total, ///
	over(author, sort(1)) ///
	ysize(8) ///
	xsize(20) /// 
	scheme(economist) ///
	title("Top 5 authors with most downloaded papers on RePEc") ///
	ytitle("Total downloads")

graph export ./img/author-most-downloaded.png, replace
```

or this:

![prolific-economists](./img/prolific-economists.png)

# Do it yourself

If instead you want to do this locally, you can just proceed the following steps. ü§ûüèΩ

# Clone

If you think this is going to be useful for your purpose, don't hesitate to clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ledwindra/ideas-repec.git
cd ideas-repec
```

To get the latest updates, run `git pull origin master`

# Permission

You can check its [robots.txt](https://logec.repec.org/robots.txt). It doesn't explicitly disallow any user to get this specific area that we would like to scrape.

```
User-agent: *

```

# Virtual environment and install dependencies

Use virtual environment if you don't want to mess around with the existing modules installed on your machine. Just run the following on terminal:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To exit from virtual environment, type and press `deactivate`. üåû üåÜ
